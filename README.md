# tipping_trouble

5/27/24:

For the sake of doing a project that will actually have some direct benefit to me, I found some interesting data from Google BigQuery with taxis in Chicago. Starting with that, we'll explore the trends of which features contribute the most to tips and try to expand to other industries as well (unsure at the moment where to find that data, but that will be part of the journey).

Ideally, I would really like to examine if tipping 'actually pays the bills' for the workers as even in industries such as food-service/restaurants (America) as in short I find it deplorable the notion that workers have to rely on tips for their base salary. However, likely that might get too politcal so I'll avoid writing that here.
